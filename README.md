<h1>How to change a PC thermal paste</h1>
This tutorial shows a simple step-by-step on how to change your PC's thermal paste .<br />


<h2>Why should we change our thermal paste?</h2>
Think of changing your thermal paste as if you're changing your car oil. It's recommended to change your thermal paste every 6-8 months, especially if you have a gaming pc. Fresh new thermal paste can improve your computer's performance and avoid overheating. 


<h2>Items needed</h2>

- Thermal paste (I'm using ARCTIC MX-4 thermal paste)
- Isopropyl 70% (This liquid is non-conductive and dries really fast, don't be scared if you accidentally drop some on your motherboard:)) )
- Microfiber Cloth
- Screwdriver (Depending on your heatsink fan, this could be a Phillips or a flat screwdriver)

<h2>Installation Steps</h2>

STEP 1: Start by removing the fans' 4 screws, which are usually located in each corner of the fan.

STEP 3: Clean leftover thermal paste on the fan and CPU

This is where you get your isopropyl and apply it to the microfiber cloth. After isopropyl is applied to the microfiber cloth, gently clean both the CPU and the Fan until there is no leftover old thermal paste. NOTE: You do not have to remove the CPU.

STEP 4: Apply new thermal paste

After the CPU and fan are clean, apply new thermal paste. Apply a pea-sized drop of thermal paste. Most AMD CPUs only require a pea-sized amount, but most Intel CPUs require you to draw an "X" on the CPU since it's longer. 

STEP 5: Screw in and reconnect the fan

After the new thermal paste is applied, gently press on the fan back on the CPU. The fan will sort of stick to the CPU cause of the thermal, this makes it easier to screw back on. Screw the 4 screws back on the fan and reconnect the fan to the 4-pin fan header. 


After all is screwed in and applied, turn your pc on and check the temperatures in BIOS. And that's all it is to change your thermal paste:).
