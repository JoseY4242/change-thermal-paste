<h1>How to change a PC thermal paste</h1>
This tutorial shows a simple step-by-step on how to change your PC's thermal paste .<br />


<h2>Why should we change our thermal paste?</h2>
Think of changing your thermal paste as if you're changing your car oil. It's recommended to change your thermal paste every 6 months, especially if you have a gaming pc. Fresh new thermal paste can improve your computer's performance and avoid overheating. 


<h2>Items needed</h2>

- thermal paste (I'm using ARCTIC MX-4 thermal paste)
- Isopropyl 70% (This liquid is non-conductive and dries really fast, don't be scared if you accidentally drop some on your motherboard:)) )
- Microfiber Cloth
- Screwdriver (Depending on your heatsink fan, this could be a Phillips or a flat screwdriver)

<h2>Installation Steps</h2>

STEP 1: Start by removing the fans' 4 screws, which are usually located in each corner of the fan.

This is where you get your isopropyl and apply it on the microfiber cloth. After isopropyl is applied to the microfiber cloth, gently clean both the CPU and the Fan until there is no leftover old thermal paste. NOTE: You do not have to remove the CPU.
